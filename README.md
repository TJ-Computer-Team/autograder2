# Pull Request By Zain Marshall

## Backend

Added JSON endpoints on top of the preexisting endpoints which only output the data embeded in the teampltes. This is a more universal standard for APIs. 

Added documentation for it. If you go to whatever url the backend is running on and then /swagger/ so for example localhost:3000/swagger. 

## Frontend

Replaced the server-side rendered Django templates with Sveltekit. Svelte is a modern reactive JS framework that allows for easily writing reapeatable components.
