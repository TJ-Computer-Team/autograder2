When not to use $effect
Effects are functions that run when state updates, and can be used for things like calling third-party libraries, drawing on <canvas> elements, or making network requests. They only run in the browser, not during server-side rendering.

Generally speaking, you should not update state inside effects, as it will make code more convoluted and will often lead to never-ending update cycles. If you find yourself doing so, see when not to use $effect to learn about alternative approaches.

You can create an effect with the $effect rune (demo):


<script>
	let size = $state(50);
	let color = $state('#ff3e00');

	let canvas;

	$effect(() => {
		const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
		context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

		// this will re-run whenever `color` or `size` change
		context.fillStyle = color;
		context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size);
	});
</script>

<canvas bind:this={canvas} width="100" height="100"></canvas>
When Svelte runs an effect function, it tracks which pieces of state (and derived state) are accessed (unless accessed inside untrack), and re-runs the function when that state later changes.

If you’re having difficulty understanding why your $effect is rerunning or is not running see understanding dependencies. Effects are triggered differently than the $: blocks you may be used to if coming from Svelte 4.

Understanding lifecycle
Your effects run after the component has been mounted to the DOM, and in a microtask after state changes. Re-runs are batched (i.e. changing color and size in the same moment won’t cause two separate runs), and happen after any DOM updates have been applied.

You can use $effect anywhere, not just at the top level of a component, as long as it is called while a parent effect is running.

Svelte uses effects internally to represent logic and expressions in your template — this is how <h1>hello {name}!</h1> updates when name changes.

An effect can return a teardown function which will run immediately before the effect re-runs (demo).


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let milliseconds = $state(1000);

	$effect(() => {
		// This will be recreated whenever `milliseconds` changes
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			count += 1;
		}, milliseconds);

		return () => {
			// if a teardown function is provided, it will run
			// a) immediately before the effect re-runs
			// b) when the component is destroyed
			clearInterval(interval);
		};
	});
</script>

<h1>{count}</h1>

<button onclick={() => (milliseconds *= 2)}>slower</button>
<button onclick={() => (milliseconds /= 2)}>faster</button>
Teardown functions also run when the effect is destroyed, which happens when its parent is destroyed (for example, a component is unmounted) or the parent effect re-runs.

Understanding dependencies
$effect automatically picks up any reactive values ($state, $derived, $props) that are synchronously read inside its function body (including indirectly, via function calls) and registers them as dependencies. When those dependencies change, the $effect schedules a re-run.

If $state and $derived are used directly inside the $effect (for example, during creation of a reactive class), those values will not be treated as dependencies.

Values that are read asynchronously — after an await or inside a setTimeout, for example — will not be tracked. Here, the canvas will be repainted when color changes, but not when size changes (demo):


$effect(() => {
	const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
	context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

	// this will re-run whenever `color` changes...
	context.fillStyle = color;

	setTimeout(() => {
		// ...but not when `size` changes
		context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size);
	}, 0);
});
An effect only reruns when the object it reads changes, not when a property inside it changes. (If you want to observe changes inside an object at dev time, you can use $inspect.)


<script>
	let state = $state({ value: 0 });
	let derived = $derived({ value: state.value * 2 });

	// this will run once, because `state` is never reassigned (only mutated)
	$effect(() => {
		state;
	});

	// this will run whenever `state.value` changes...
	$effect(() => {
		state.value;
	});

	// ...and so will this, because `derived` is a new object each time
	$effect(() => {
		derived;
	});
</script>

<button onclick={() => (state.value += 1)}>
	{state.value}
</button>

<p>{state.value} doubled is {derived.value}</p>
An effect only depends on the values that it read the last time it ran. This has interesting implications for effects that have conditional code.

For instance, if condition is true in the code snippet below, the code inside the if block will run and color will be evaluated. This means that changes to either condition or color will cause the effect to re-run.

Conversely, if condition is false, color will not be evaluated, and the effect will only re-run again when condition changes.


import confetti from 'canvas-confetti';

let condition = $state(true);
let color = $state('#ff3e00');

$effect(() => {
	if (condition) {
		confetti({ colors: [color] });
	} else {
		confetti();
	}
});
$effect.pre
In rare cases, you may need to run code before the DOM updates. For this we can use the $effect.pre rune:


<script>
	import { tick } from 'svelte';

	let div = $state();
	let messages = $state([]);

	// ...

	$effect.pre(() => {
		if (!div) return; // not yet mounted

		// reference `messages` array length so that this code re-runs whenever it changes
		messages.length;

		// autoscroll when new messages are added
		if (div.offsetHeight + div.scrollTop > div.scrollHeight - 20) {
			tick().then(() => {
				div.scrollTo(0, div.scrollHeight);
			});
		}
	});
</script>

<div bind:this={div}>
	{#each messages as message}
		<p>{message}</p>
	{/each}
</div>
Apart from the timing, $effect.pre works exactly like $effect.

$effect.tracking
The $effect.tracking rune is an advanced feature that tells you whether or not the code is running inside a tracking context, such as an effect or inside your template (demo):


<script>
	console.log('in component setup:', $effect.tracking()); // false

	$effect(() => {
		console.log('in effect:', $effect.tracking()); // true
	});
</script>

<p>in template: {$effect.tracking()}</p> <!-- true -->
It is used to implement abstractions like createSubscriber, which will create listeners to update reactive values but only if those values are being tracked (rather than, for example, read inside an event handler).

$effect.pending
When using await in components, the $effect.pending() rune tells you how many promises are pending in the current boundary, not including child boundaries (demo):


<button onclick={() => a++}>a++</button>
<button onclick={() => b++}>b++</button>

<p>{a} + {b} = {await add(a, b)}</p>

{#if $effect.pending()}
	<p>pending promises: {$effect.pending()}</p>
{/if}
$effect.root
The $effect.root rune is an advanced feature that creates a non-tracked scope that doesn’t auto-cleanup. This is useful for nested effects that you want to manually control. This rune also allows for the creation of effects outside of the component initialisation phase.


const destroy = $effect.root(() => {
	$effect(() => {
		// setup
	});

	return () => {
		// cleanup
	};
});

// later...
destroy();
When not to use $effect
In general, $effect is best considered something of an escape hatch — useful for things like analytics and direct DOM manipulation — rather than a tool you should use frequently. In particular, avoid using it to synchronise state. Instead of this...


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let doubled = $state();

	// don't do this!
	$effect(() => {
		doubled = count * 2;
	});
</script>
...do this:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
</script>
For things that are more complicated than a simple expression like count * 2, you can also use $derived.by.

If you’re using an effect because you want to be able to reassign the derived value (to build an optimistic UI, for example) note that deriveds can be directly overridden as of Svelte 5.25.

You might be tempted to do something convoluted with effects to link one value to another. The following example shows two inputs for “money spent” and “money left” that are connected to each other. If you update one, the other should update accordingly. Don’t use effects for this (demo):


<script>
	const total = 100;
	let spent = $state(0);
	let left = $state(total);

	$effect(() => {
		left = total - spent;
	});

	$effect(() => {
		spent = total - left;
	});
</script>

<label>
	<input type="range" bind:value={spent} max={total} />
	{spent}/{total} spent
</label>

<label>
	<input type="range" bind:value={left} max={total} />
	{left}/{total} left
</label>
Instead, use oninput callbacks or — better still — function bindings where possible (demo):


<script>
	const total = 100;
	let spent = $state(0);
	let left = $derived(total - spent);

	function updateLeft(left) {
		spent = total - left;
	}
</script>

<label>
	<input type="range" bind:value={spent} max={total} />
	{spent}/{total} spent
</label>

<label>
	<input type="range" bind:value={() => left, updateLeft} max={total} />
	{left}/{total} left
</label>
If you absolutely have to update $state within an effect and run into an infinite loop because you read and write to the same $state, use untrack.
